SmartDec is a set of tools for decompilation. These tools are:

    * nocode — a command-line decompiler;
    * smartdec — a decompiler with graphical user interface;
    * ida-plugin — a decompiler plug-in for the IDA Pro disassembler.

For building instructions, see the file named `doc/build.txt'.
For an overview of decompiler's architecture, see `doc/developer'.

Use `make' (or directly `pdflatex main.tex' twice) to build PDF files
inside the directories.

OSX Installation
================

1. Attempt to run `make` and see what error occur, likely a `ctag` and `cmake` error.

2. Ensure you update `ctag` via `brew`, otherwise you will get an error similar to;

> [93%]tstrazzere@bebop:[smartdec] $ ctags --c++-kinds=+p --fields=+iaS --extra=+q -R /Users/tstrazzere/repo/smartdec/src
> /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/ctags: illegal option -- -
> usage: ctags [-BFadtuwvx] [-f tagsfile] file ...

3. Then install `cmake` via `brew` as well if you do not already have it.

4. Ensure `cmake` is able to find your IDA Pro directory and IDA Pro SDK, these have been added to the `modules/FindIDA.cmake` file as they where on my system, though ensure they match your system. Setting the path to the environment variable `IDA_PATH` should help.

5. Ensure `cmake` is able to access `boost` - if not try installing if via `brew`; `brew install boost`
